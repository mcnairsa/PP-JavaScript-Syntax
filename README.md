##Portfilio Project - JavaScript Syntax [aka: Mixed Messages]

This project creates a JavaScript program to derive a haiku in three lines from three separate arrays [or objects?] with one line chosen at random coming from each array. The arrays will always be used in the same sequence.

The project meets the Definition of Completeion given in the instructions:

- Plan project [this README file]

- Come up with a topic
  - Haiku on three lines in two parts but being flexible about the 5-7-5 rule

- Create script and run it locally

- Set up version control


- Store message

- Create the message

- Put the program together

##Outline Specificaiton of Program
###Data
- A haiku consists of three lines
- Line One has:
  - a verb [phrase including...]
  - an adverb
  - a noun
  - an adjective
- Line Two has
  - an animal (noun)
  - a verb of movement
- Line Three has:
  - a verb of sensation
  - a noun
  - an adverb

Each line is represented by an array of arrays.
Each inner array contains one of the above categories.

###Process
- Initialise the arrays as above [hard coded for now].
- Take a random element from each inner array to build a 'line string'. 
- Format & print the formated line strings.
